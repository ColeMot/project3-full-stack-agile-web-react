Final group project for Software Engineering, finished on 11/13/REMOVED. Goal was to make a restaurant POS system using cloud computing and web programming. Database set up using PostgresSQL hosted on AWS. We choose to use React for the front-end. 

Requirements

Your product should meet the following minimum requirements:

    Web-based application. The application’s primary mode of interaction should be through a browser interface. It must run, at minimum, in Chrome. It should not require any extensions to run in the browser.
    PostgreSQL hosted on AWS.  It must connect to the AWS server and postgreSQL database you used in Project 2.  You can (and probably should) modify your database's schema and seed data.
    Serve 4 main different types of users or views: managers, cashiers, customers, and menu boards. The application should adapt to the different needs of each user type.
    Serves additional user management view for system admin
    Make use of 3 external APIs: 3rd-party authentication, translation, and a weather service of your choice.
        3rd-party authentication: A web service that performs user authentication. e.g. Google OAuth2 
        translation: A web service that performs translation. e.g. Google Translate
        weather service: A web service that provides weather data. e.g. OpenWeather

Address accessibility by complying with WCAG 2.1
Links to an external site. and the needs of given personae in your design.

You will use an Agile SDLC for this project.

    Due to team size, and even more significantly, due to time constraints, we will not be able to follow a “real” agile approach, but we will try to capture some of the main themes from an Agile development process using Scrum.
    Time management will be crucial to your success. Requirement changes from your initial design will come from the user studies that you make.

Approach

We will use an iterative approach to this assignment.

    Your team will be asked to implement the program over three “Sprints”, each one week in length.
    Features and functionality (i.e. "value") should be added during each Sprint.
    At the end of each Sprint, your team should have working software.
    Between each Sprint is a 1-week reflection and planning period.
    In addition, you are to make backlogs, create burn-down charts, and hold Scrum meetings.

Management

We will use Scrum Masters in this assignment.
The Scrum Masters from each team will meet with the instructor and TA every Tuesday throughout the duration of the project (except on the Team Meeting week.)
The goals of this approximately 15-minute meeting are to:

    give an update to the instructors and TAs
    share what is working and not working with other Scrum Masters.
